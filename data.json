added We are yet to receive a full comprehensive report on the impact of these latest heavy rains but as reports come in a worrying picture is however emerging In April torrential rain led to floods landslides and the death of  people in KwaZuluNatal and authorities said survivors were left without drinking water for nearly two weeks Repairs are still ongoing after the floods caused damage worth hundreds of millions of dollars On Sunday parts of the road near the Umdloti beach resort north of Durban had been washed away leaving gaping holes and cars balanced on the edge AFP news agency reportedThe flooding started late yesterday Saturday afternoon but as a result of the collapse of this road we couldnt get out one local resident Kevin Govender told AFPThey were only able to get out once the emergency services arrived on SundayNearly  people were evacuated from the resort town overnight and rescue operations continued on Sunday as the emergency services received more calls for

highest on Saturday Officials called on residents to stay at homeAuthorities in KwaZuluNatal opened  reception centres while police firefighters and rescue workers were ready to respond rapidly to

country flooding towns and destroying housesThe initial death toll in the southern African country was estimated at sevenData showed Gombe had completely destroyed  homes and partially destroyed In the past few years Southern Africa has suffered repeated devastating cyclones of the type that used to be relatively rare and scientists believe climate change is fuelling their intensity via warming

other posts including the finance minister as part of a cabinet reshuffleA statement from the presidency on Thursday named Adriano Afonso Maleiane as the replacement for Carlos Agostinho do

Vladimir Putin officially sent troops into eastern UkraineNord Stream  an bn gas pipeline project owned by Moscowbacked energy company Gazprom runs from western Siberia to Germany The project was built to ensure a sustainable energy distribution across the European Union especially as gas prices reached record highs in Europe  which gets more than a third of its natural gas from RussiaAs the conflict continues in Ukraine European gas prices have soared and there is the likelihood that Moscow could shut off supplies of gas widely considered part of Putins leverage against the West in his obsession with UkraineBefore that European countries will be pulling the stops to find contingency supply networks in the coming weeks In fact sources say the United States is already in talks with Qatar over supplying gas to the EU as a crucial substitute for RussiaHowever during a forum of gas exporting countries held last week in Qatar the bloc said it would be unable to provide a considerable amount of replacement gas to Europe in the event of sanctions against Russia They stressed the need for significant investment in gas infrastructure as well as longterm contracts to guarantee a large supply to EuropeThis has led to an emerging debate about whether African countries which have some of the worlds deepest gas reserves can step in to fill the gap  a demand of  billion cubic metres annually that Russia has usually supplied to EuropeRecently\u00a0Tanzanian President Samia Suluhu Hassan said the Russian invasion of Ukraine could prove to be an opportunity for gas sales as the East African country makes efforts to secure a new energy market outside Africa Whether Africa or Europe or America we are looking for markets said Hassan And fortunately we are working with companies from EuropeTanzania which has the sixthlargest gas reserves in Africa  an estimated  trillion cubic feet  billion cubic metres of gas reserves  says it has been working with Shell to utilise its vast offshore gas resources and export to Europe and elsewhereAfricas largest gas producer has similar plans too Timipre Sylva Nigerias junior petroleum minister told the press at the gas exporting countries forum in Doha We want to build a pipeline a transSahara pipeline that is going to take our gas to Algeria then to EuropeNigerias comments are buoyed by the recent signing of an MoU with Algeria and the Niger Republic and the ongoing construction of the TransSaharan Gas Pipeline a km  miles long natural gas pipeline beginning in northern NigeriaThere is no official word on when the pipeline first mooted in the s will be completed but it is slated to run through northern Nigeria into Niger and Algeria connecting to Europe eventuallyStill there are concerns about whether African countries can become a proper stopgap solution for natural gas as Europe tackles Russias military onslaught against one of its own  or longterm suppliersExperts say a historic lack of investment in gas infrastructure has hampered the energy industry in subSaharan Africa unlike in Northern AfricaFor instance the MaghrebEurope Gas Pipeline in Algeria  Africas largest natural gas exporter  conveys natural gas through Morocco to Spain and Portugal and the Medgaz pipeline links Algeria directly to SpainExperts estimated that Algeria exported  billion cubic feet  million cubic metres of gas to Spain in  and up to  billion cubic feet  million cubic metres annually before that The drop was due to gas production dipping in a breakdown in relations with Morocco last October Algeria announced that it would immediately begin exporting gas directly to SpainIt is important to note that North Africa already has an established gas export market with Europe before the Ukrainian crisis said Linda MabhenaOlagunju oil and gas lawyer and CEO of Johannesburgbased independent power producer DLO Energy Resource Group The Medgaz pipeline capacity enhancements in Algeria are also expected to increase exports to EuropeBut many African countries with massive gas reserves have also struggled to attract investment to build gas infrastructure projects to supply the European marketAngola which has  trillion cubic feet  billion cubic metres of proven gas reserves has experienced a sharp decline in oil and gas production in the last five years due to a combination of technical and operational problems as well as a lack of upstream investment and incentivesIn  the Muhammadu Buhari administration announced The Decade of Gas a Nigerian initiative to prioritise the gas industry and take advantage of a global transition to cleaner fuelsAs part of that drive it has commenced construction of the kmlong bn AjaokutaKadunaKano Natural Gas Pipeline Most of the funding comes as a loan from Chinese banksStill like in many other African countries significant investments are needed to build transregional and intercontinental pipelines in order to open up access to Europe And they all need loads of capitalNigeria is hoping that its new industry legislation  signed last August  can provide a new framework to cut down on waste and corruption in the oil sector reshape host community relations and ultimately investmentNigeria is not presently a top investment destination for the oil and gas industry said Joe Nwakwue former chairman of the Society of Petroleum Engineers in Nigeria and exadviser to the junior petroleum minister This was why we pushed for a competitive fiscal arrangement in the billAdditionally to address the infrastructure challenge we need to open up the sector to private capital he said Our current oligopoly would not suffice as the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation lacks the capital to build our required infrastructureUsing vessels for direct transport of liquefied natural gas across the seas could also put subSaharan African countries in prime position to become competitive producers and exporters MabhenaOlagunju told Al JazeeraThere are also other existential issues that experts say African countries have to fix first to be a ready alternative for Europe in situations of urgencyMozambique holds roughly  trillion cubic feet  trillion cubic metres of proven natural gas reserves accounting for approximately  percent of the worlds total reserves But an\u00a0ongoing armed uprising\u00a0in the northern Mozambican province of Cabo Delgado a gasrich area that borders Tanzania has\u00a0hampered activity on a planned bn projectElsewhere a wave of security threats from armed groups has affected oil and gas exploration in Nigerias oilrich Niger DeltaThe key factor that remains a challenge for Africa as a reliable LNG producer and exporter revolves around security of supply said MabhenaOlagunju Whilst the LNG discoveries in Mozambique are a great find it is also important to recognise that insecurity leads to delays and instability of supplyCan African countries wing it",
